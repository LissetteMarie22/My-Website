	<h1> Welome to my place in the world! </h1>
			<div id="firstParagraph"><p> Hi! My name is Lissette Marie Ramos, this is a digital representation of the place in the world I've carved out for myself. This is the life I've built, but  it wasn't built with just my two hands. Who I am and where I am in life is what it is in huge part because of my friends and family who love,support, and inspire me. I love programming things that I know will help people in some way, even if it's just something that puts a smile on someone's face - that's a successful project to me. I have experience in many different languages and am very open minded, eager to learn new technologies. I also love to learn about different subjects so that I am well informed about the subject of my project and can deliver outstanding solutions.</p>
		
			   The site is divided a few pages: this home page, where I explain who I am;"Projects" page shows what projects I've worked and what I currently am working on, to give you an idea of what I'm capable of as a programmer; "My Unique Impact" explains how I am unique and what sets me apart from other programmers; finally "Comments" will take you to a page where you can submit your comments and suggestions about my page. </p>
